## Tech Stack
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Features
- Interactive Introduction Page: Allows users to explore predefined questions about me, with answers displayed in a formatted, JSON-like interface for a unique and developer-focused presentation.
- Experience Timeline: A visually structured timeline that outlines my academic background and professional experience in chronological order.
- Project Gallery: A curated list of personal and academic projects, complete with filtering functionality that allows users to view projects by specific technologies used.

## Challenges & What I Learned
One of the key challenges was implementing a dynamic project filtering system while maintaining component reusability and state management best practices. This project significantly improved my understanding of TypeScript and how to enforce type safety across components. 

## Future Iterations Plan
- Enhance filtering by allowing user to select more than one technology stack
- Introduce a user-controlled light/dark mode toggle for better accessibility and personalization
- Enhance website responsiveness across different screen size
